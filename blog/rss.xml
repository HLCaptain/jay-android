            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally had the time to finish this huge update, what I started developing more than a year ago: <strong>on-device machine learning</strong>. Users now can analyze device sensor data with an on-device machine learning algorithm to predict <strong>driver aggression</strong>.</p><p>The ML model can be downloaded via <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/ml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase ML service</a>. The development of the <strong>model</strong> is also fully <strong>open-sourced</strong> and available under the <a href="https://github.com/HLCaptain/hawk-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawk AI GitHub repository</a> with scripts to train and convert the model to the TensorFlow Lite format.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plans">Plans<a href="#plans" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Plans" title="Direct link to Plans">​</a></h2><ul><li>Rework session screen with better data visualization.</li></ul><p>For the foreseeable future, I don't plan to add more core features to the app, but when something comes up, I will resolve any issues.</p><p>I hope this will change in the future, but for now, enjoy what I consider a solid open-source base for Android application development.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This site was created to <strong>document changes</strong> and have a <strong>landing page</strong> of the Android version of <strong>Jay</strong>.</p><p>I plan to experiment with <strong>blog posts</strong>, like <em>this</em>, to get the hang of managing this side of a production ready-ish app. A brief description of Jay, and what the project is aiming for:</p><p>Jay is a data analytics solution, which aims to make data analytics more accessible for <strong><em>Everyone</em></strong>. The Android app collects data on-device, which can be uploaded to the cloud to be analyzed and make local decisions on local problems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Features" title="Direct link to Features">​</a></h2><ul><li>Collect and display sensory and location data</li><li>Upload and sync data in the cloud</li><li>Support multiple users on a single device</li><li>Provide an easy-to-use and good looking interface</li><li>Be cheap to implement and maintain</li><li>Analyze data</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plans">Plans<a href="#plans" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Plans" title="Direct link to Plans">​</a></h2><ul><li>digitally generate and label data, which then can be used to train machine learning models</li><li>analyze/process data on-device with ML models</li><li>enable users to have supervisors for B2B applications</li><li>make an administration app/webpage to supervise users</li><li>make even more tools and solutions accessible, be as transparent as possible during development</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

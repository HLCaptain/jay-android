# Privacy Policy

Balázs Püspök-Kiss (Illyan) built the Jay app as an Ad Supported app. This SERVICE is provided by Balázs Püspök-Kiss (Illyan) at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Jay unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

Additonal information which are required to provide app functionality:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII): We may collect PII such as your name, email address, and phone number when you provide it to us (via Firebase services), for example during registration or when you contact us for support.
- Device Information: We collect device-specific information such as your device's unique identifier (Client ID, which is generated on first startup of the app), device name, and operating system version. This information helps us to provide a better experience and to troubleshoot issues.
- Location Data: We collect location data, including, but not limited to GeoPoint, altitude, and speed data, along with Timestamps, when a (user controlled) Session is running, even when the app is in the background or closed. This information is used to provide analytics about your taken path, such as your speed on your route and to display where you have been while driving.
- Sensory Data: We collect custom sensory data containing the type of sensor, three values (probably floating-point numbers), and a Timestamp when the measure was taken.
- User Preferences: We collect user preferences, which represent your settings and preferences within the app. Preferences can affect data collection, client behavior, and synchronization between devices.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

## Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.

## Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

- To facilitate our Service;

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children’s Privacy

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

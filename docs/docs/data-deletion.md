### Expand options to see more

Expanding an option reveals, what the action is doing. To sum it up:

- Delete public data: deleting public data available to everyone on the device. This means, all public data is deleted or reset, which is generated by the offline (unidentified) user.
- Delete from device: deleting own data from the device, clearing any data stored on the device linked to you.
- Delete from cloud: deleting all of your data from the cloud, erasing your existance from Firestore servers.
- Delete all user data: deletes user data from the device and from the cloud.

### Delete all user data

Deleting all user data resets and stops syncing user preferences to avoid automatically uploading it to the cloud.

### Go back to Settings

And notice, that user preferences syncing has stopped, no data is sent to the cloud.

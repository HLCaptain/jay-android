I finally had the time to finish this huge update, what I started developing more than a year ago: **on-device machine learning**. Users now can analyze device sensor data with an on-device machine learning algorithm to predict **driver aggression**.

The ML model can be downloaded via [Firebase ML service](https://firebase.google.com/products/ml). The development of the **model** is also fully **open-sourced** and available under the [Hawk AI GitHub repository](https://github.com/HLCaptain/hawk-ai) with scripts to train and convert the model to the TensorFlow Lite format.

## Plans

- Rework session screen with better data visualization.

For the foreseeable future, I don't plan to add more core features to the app, but when something comes up, I will resolve any issues.

I hope this will change in the future, but for now, enjoy what I consider a solid open-source base for Android application development.

This site was created to **document changes** and have a **landing page** of the Android version of **Jay**.

I plan to experiment with **blog posts**, like *this*, to get the hang of managing this side of a production ready-ish app. A brief description of Jay, and what the project is aiming for:

Jay is a data analytics solution, which aims to make data analytics more accessible for ***Everyone***. The Android app collects data on-device, which can be uploaded to the cloud to be analyzed and make local decisions on local problems.

## Features

- Collect and display sensory and location data
- Upload and sync data in the cloud
- Support multiple users on a single device
- Provide an easy-to-use and good looking interface
- Be cheap to implement and maintain
- Analyze data

## Plans

- digitally generate and label data, which then can be used to train machine learning models
- analyze/process data on-device with ML models
- enable users to have supervisors for B2B applications
- make an administration app/webpage to supervise users
- make even more tools and solutions accessible, be as transparent as possible during development

<!-- Jay aims to make data analytics more accessible, give it back to the hands of people. In this day and age, value's definition has been drastically changed, for the worse. People's attention and data is being *exploited*, just to say it lightly. -->

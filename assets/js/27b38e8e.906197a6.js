The Android app collects data on-device, which can be uploaded to the cloud to be analyzed and make local decisions on local problems.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- Collect and display sensory and location data\\n- Upload and sync data in the cloud\\n- Support multiple users on a single device\\n- Provide an easy-to-use and good looking interface\\n- Be cheap to implement and maintain\\n- Analyze data\\n\\n## Plans\\n\\n- digitally generate and label data, which then can be used to train machine learning models\\n- analyze/process data on-device with ML models\\n- enable users to have supervisors for B2B applications\\n- make an administration app/webpage to supervise users\\n- make even more tools and solutions accessible, be as transparent as possible during development"}]}')}}]);

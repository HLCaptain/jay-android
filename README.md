# Jay Android Application

Driver behaviour analytics app.

## üöß Under development üöß

I am currently porting from XML ‚û° [Jetpack Compose] and besides
only rewriting the whole UI from scratch,
I had to switch architectures as well from [RainbowCake] üéÇ ‚û° [MVVM].

A few technologies and features that is ported or will be present:

- Saving data locally via [Room]
- Dependency Injection with the Compose implementation of [Hilt]
- Navigation in the app is helped by [Compose Destinations]
- Authentication, data sync, etc. is handled by [Firebase] services
- [Mapbox] is used instead of Google Maps to scale better
- Analyze collected data with [ML Kit] and get statistics on your phone, locally
- Amazing UX/UI experience (development on [Figma Design Page])
- Static code analysis via [SonarCloud]
- Testing with a Kotlin native mocking library [MockK]

## Run the project üèÉüí®

You need to do ‚ö† 2 ‚ö† things after cloning the repository!

### Get your [Firebase] integration üî•

You need to modify the package of the project, because
[Firebase] ***WILL NOT*** let you add Jay as an Android project,
because I already have a project with this package.
You might as well change the name of it, but it's optional.

After you added the Android project, then you should follow
the instructions [Firebase] gave you (download `google-services.json`).

### Initialize [Mapbox] üó∫

You will need a [Mapbox account] in order to get the private and public
keys to get it up and running.

Follow the [Mapbox Initialization] guide for further information.
I placed both of my keys in the `¬´USER_HOME¬ª/.gradle/gradle.properties` file.

### ‚ö† ‚ö† ‚ö† DON'T FORGET ‚ö† ‚ö† ‚ö†

Never add `google-services.json` and `¬´USER_HOME¬ª/.gradle/gradle.properties`
into your forked repository and I would recommend keeping
your `string.xml` file squeaky clean üßπüßΩüßº as well
(don't place any keys, either public or private or confidential information there).

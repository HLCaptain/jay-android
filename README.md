In short, Jay is providing data to decide on local problems and in the transportation field. Jay should be easy to use and available to have as much impact as possible.

### About the app

- Save sensory/location data locally and sync it to the cloud
- Record a session in the background to provide seamless tracking
- Utilize its capabilities with multiple users on a single device
- Show information about your session
- UX/UI centered design, with dark mode theming

### A few technologies Jay implements

- Saving tracked data locally via [Room]
- Dependency Injection with the Compose implementation of [Hilt]
- Navigation in the app is helped by [Compose Destinations]
- Authentication, data sync, etc. is handled by [Firebase] services
- [Mapbox] is used instead of Google Maps to scale better
- Amazing (or at least not bad) UX/UI experience (development on [Figma Design Page])
- Static code analysis via [SonarCloud]

## Setup and run the project üèÉ

You need to do 3 things after cloning the repository to make the app rely only on your services.

### Adding Android project to [Firebase] üî•

You need to modify the package of the project, because [Firebase] ***WILL NOT*** let you add Jay as an Android project, because I already have a project with this package. You might as well change the name of it, but it's optional.

After you added the Android project, then you should follow the instructions [Firebase] gave you (download `google-services.json`).

### Install [Mapbox] üó∫

You will need a [Mapbox account] in order to get the private and public keys to get it up and running.

Follow the [Mapbox install] guide for further information. I placed both of my keys in the `¬´USER_HOME¬ª/.gradle/gradle.properties` file.

### Set up [SonarCloud] properly

Don't forget to change your properties in the project
level `build.gradle` file.

### Few tips for security

- Never add `google-services.json` and `¬´USER_HOME¬ª/.gradle/gradle.properties` into your forked repository.
- I would recommend keeping your `string.xml` file squeaky clean üßπüßΩüßº (don't place any keys, either public or private or confidential information there), use Firebase's [Remote Config] service or place keys in `local.properties`.
